"""Skin entries and node trees from the server's views and the native selection.

Every server view is a ``Kofin.nodes.*`` entry. A whitelisted video library
gets the generated node tree under ``special://profile/library/video/kofin/``
(``nodes/video.write_tree``) and ``library://`` paths in its properties, and
everything else is a dynamic ``browse`` entry. The tree's filter nodes select
by the folder the library's rows are filed under (``paths.library_dir``): a
movie's folder or an episode's show folder is below it, and Kodi files the row
on that path because its URL has a query (``CVideoDatabase::SplitPath``). A
whitelisted music library gets a folder in the music tree
(``nodes/music.write_music_nodes``), whose nodes filter on the folder the
library's songs are filed under; its skin entry is Kodi's music root. The
folder's path is what the Manage menu reads a library's downloads from
(``plugin/context.py``).

Ownership is the ``kofin`` name prefix throughout (``nodes/fs.py``): a tree
rewrite reconciles the folder against what it wrote and never touches a
hand-made node beside it, and an empty whitelist takes the whole tree down.

One setting switches the generated presentation as a whole (``SETTING``):
the tree, the smart playlists beside it and the Jellyfin playlists
(``backends/api/playlists.py`` reads the same switch). Off, the files Kofin
wrote go the way an empty whitelist takes them and a synced video library is
published as a browse entry, like an unsynced one; Kodi's own library and the
rows in it are untouched.

Kodi's shipped video nodes are seeded into the profile before the tree is
written (``kodisetup.seed_default_nodes``): the moment
``special://profile/library/video/`` exists, every ``library://video/...``
path resolves there and nowhere else (CLibraryDirectory::GetDirectory, no
merge), so a profile holding only ``kofin/`` lists nothing for
``library://video/movies/`` and a skin's categories row goes empty. The
music tree gets Kodi's shipped music nodes the same way.

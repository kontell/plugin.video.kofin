"""The apply pass: desired state against the scanner's row, patched only
where they differ, confirmed by readback, acknowledged by the batch.

Setters merge maps and replace tags, so a patch clears only the keys Kofin
owned last time and keeps what Kodi or the user added. A refresh is the one
operation that replaces a row: cast and streams have no setter.

Music is confirmed by the scope, not the row. A song's patch is its play
count and last played; thousands of them on a first import would cost a
details call each to confirm, so the kinds the scanner derives are patched
in batches and then read back in one listing per library.

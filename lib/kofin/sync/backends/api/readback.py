"""Scoped readback of owned rows: one library's movies, one show's episodes,
one library's songs.

A video row is owned only when its namespaced unique id and its exact
resolver URL both say so. A song has no unique id -- Kodi keeps none for
music -- so its ownership is its URL alone: the directory it is filed under
is ours and the file name names the item. Readings are cached for the pass
that made them and dropped whenever a scan or a removal could have changed
them.

A music directory is read on its own, one filtered listing, until a pass
asks for the whole library (``folders``, ``songs_in`` from
``WHOLE_LIBRARY_FOLDERS`` directories on); then every song is read in one
listing (paged, 5,000 to a page), split by directory here, and every
directory is answered from it.

"""Read public Kodi capabilities inside the addon; no HTTP server required.

``inspect`` is the probe the service runs at every start. The baseline
decides whether native sync runs at all, and the feature table says what
this Kodi offers beyond it (``contract.py``). The report is written to
``REPORT`` in the profile by the service, and ``features`` and ``table``
are how the rest of the add-on -- the pass, the listing provider in the
plugin process, the play route, SyncPlay -- read what was found, by name,
without a probe of their own. A feature that is off is named once, in the
service log at start and in the Library status dialog, never per item.

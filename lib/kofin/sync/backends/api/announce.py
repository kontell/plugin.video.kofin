"""New content in the API build: the toasts, and the downloads that follow it.

The SQL build announces what its *added* writers wrote (sync/library.py,
notify_new_content). This build has no writer. An item is new when a
catch-up publishes it and the catalogue places no item of its id, and it has
arrived when the pass has filed it, which is when its catalogue row is
applied: the toast comes with the row, as the SQL build's waits for its
writers. A complete enumeration (a first listing, Update libraries, the
schedule) and a repair announce nothing, as the SQL build's full sync does
not, and a played item is never announced (newcontent.entry_for).

"""Fine position sync for SyncPlay: tempo pulses through Kodi's own tempo.

Stock Kodi plays a tempo only while "Sync playback to display" is on, and that
setting slaves the media clock to the panel. With the ``tempo`` feature
(kontell/xbmc #14 and #16) Kodi plays the tempo in the audio itself (a resample
ratio the engine keeps) and lets the audio be the clock, so the tempo works
with the display clock **off**. #37 keeps a tempo beyond the atempo threshold
from drawing a clock correction. #15 gives PAPlayer the same tempo, so music
takes pulses too, within limits of its own (``music_profile``).

Three parts here:

* :class:`KodiTempo` — the actuator: ``Player.SetTempo`` and the ``tempo``
  property over JSON-RPC, since Python's ``xbmc.Player`` has no tempo call,
  and ``Player.TempoEnabled`` as the test of whether the playing item can
  take one at all.
* :class:`TempoSession` — whether this group membership has fine sync: the
  setting, read at join and whenever it changes.
* :class:`PulseScheduler` — between group commands, measure the residual
  against the group estimate and close it with a *pulse*: a rate ``r`` held
  for ``T`` seconds displaces the position by ``(r − 1) × T``. One pulse,
  confirmed by reading the tempo back, then a quiet window before the
  residual is trusted again.

The planner is Kodi-free so the arithmetic is unit testable; the scheduler
takes its player reads through the controller.

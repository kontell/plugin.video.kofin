"""Sidecar subtitles as local files, so Kodi's own menu can name them.

Kodi reads a subtitle's language and label out of its **filename**, and
Jellyfin's delivery route fixes it: every attached track arrives as
``Stream.<codec>``. Worse, that stem matches the video stream's own
(``/Videos/<id>/stream.mkv``), so Kodi strips it as a redundant prefix and is
left with nothing at all. So the file has to be local, and this module is the
only thing in kofin that fetches media content on the play path.

**Everything attached**: sidecars, plus at most the one embedded track a
transcode was resolved with (``streams.attached_subtitles``). Kodi opens every
attached subtitle while building the demuxer, and an embedded track is
extracted on demand by the server, so an embedded track that cannot be fetched
here is never given to Kodi by its URL: the URL is what stalls. It is
*deferred* instead — handed back to the caller so the service can chase it
while the picture runs (``service/latesubs.py``). A sidecar still falls back
to its URL, because the server serves a file it already has and Kodi opening
it costs nothing.

A cold extraction takes tens of seconds and is cached after, and abandoning
the request does not abandon the work: the extraction runs to completion
server-side, which is what makes chasing it worthwhile rather than a second
cold start.

Kodi parses ``<name>.<language>[.forced].<ext>``: a name, the language, and
``forced`` when it applies. Nothing else, because anything Kodi does not parse
ends up rendered.

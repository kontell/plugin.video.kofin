# The routes that answer a directory fetch themselves: they either build a
# listing and call endOfDirectory (browse and friends, lyrics) or resolve a
# playable item with setResolvedUrl (play, on every path including its
# failures). Every other route runs for its side effect and returns nothing,
# and dispatch closes the handle on its behalf.
#
# With reuselanguageinvoker the invoker thread parks between invocations
# instead of exiting, and Kodi only marks a script done from
# CLanguageInvokerThread::OnExit — so CScriptRunner::WaitOnScriptResult, which
# loops on IsRunning(scriptId) with no timeout on its first loop, waits forever
# for a route that leaves its handle open. test_router.py refuses any ROUTES
# entry that is in neither set.

"""The LAN server picker (Account-tab settings button -> RunPlugin).

Broadcasts Jellyfin's UDP discovery probe (kofin.core.discovery), verifies
each answer over HTTP, and writes the chosen address into ``serverAddress``
so the Log in button below it has something to work with.

Two things about the shape are load-bearing.

The settings button carries ``<close>true</close>``, so Kodi has committed
and closed the settings dialog before this route runs. That is not house
style: a setting written from here into a dialog that is still open is
reverted when the user backs out of it (the hazard ``service/backdrop.py``
records). Having closed it, the route reopens it — same builtin as
``actions.open_settings`` — so the filled field is the confirmation and Log
in is the next press.

The verification is not a liveness check. The server answered the broadcast
milliseconds ago, so it is plainly alive; what is in question is the address
it published, which Jellyfin derives per caller and which can name a host
this box cannot resolve or route to. When it cannot be reached, the datagram's
own source address is tried, that being the one endpoint in the exchange
known to work.

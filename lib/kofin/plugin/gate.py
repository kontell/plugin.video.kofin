"""At most two builds of one listing at a time, decided before anything is
imported.

A skin asks for its home widgets again at every visit to Home, and Kodi
starts the next request whether or not the last has answered. Each is an
invoker thread and an interpreter of its own (Kodi keeps one parked invoker
for the whole of Python, and a skin's own plugin calls take it), so nothing
is shared between them and each pays for every import again. When listings
are slow, a first import on a small device, the same URL is being built
many times over, each build slower for the others, until Kodi cannot create
another thread: on a Raspberry Pi 3 it aborted with about thirty requests
for the add-on's root waiting, three times.

So ``default.py`` comes here first. A request that is turned away has
imported this module and Kodi's own built-ins, and none of the rest of
kofin: turned away after the router's imports it still took forty seconds
under that load, nearly all of them spent reaching the decision, and Kodi
aborted all the same.

The slots are window properties, the one thing separate interpreters share
(``core/state.py`` names them; importing it is what this module exists to
avoid). A slot holds ``<deadline>|<nonce>``, the deadline on the monotonic
clock the whole process shares. Slots, not a counter: a count two requests
update at once drifts and stays wrong, and one stuck high would turn every
listing away for good, where a slot whose request died is free again at its
deadline.

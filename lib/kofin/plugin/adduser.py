"""'Who's watching?' route handlers.

The feature's vocabulary, the toggle picker and the session restore live in
``service/whoswatching.py`` — the picker blocks on a dialog and runs on a
service worker thread, so a plugin invocation only validates and fires the
IPC (see the note on :func:`who_is_watching` for why blocking here breaks
node invocation). The Advanced-tab shortlist dialog stays a route: the
settings button runs in the plugin process and may block.

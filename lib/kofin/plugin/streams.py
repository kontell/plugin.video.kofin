"""Audio and subtitle selection for a playback already running.

Reached from the context menu on the played item, which the viewer gets back
to by pressing Back or Tab — fullscreen video itself has no context menu, but
leaving it does not stop playback, and the item stays focused with
``ListItem.IsPlaying`` true.

Three kinds of change, and the differences are the whole reason this module
exists. A subtitle Kodi already holds — anything embedded on a direct play,
anything attached as a file — switches in place, instantly. A text subtitle a
transcode did not attach is fetched from the server and added to the running
playback, which costs a wait but no gap: this module states the index and the
service does the waiting (:func:`_fetch_subtitle`). Only two things still
resolve a new stream, because only they cannot be answered any other way —
audio on a transcode, since Jellyfin bakes one track into the HLS output and
offers no alternates, and an image subtitle on a transcode, which can only
reach the screen burned into the video.

No API call happens here. Everything the menus show was resolved by the play
route's own PlaybackInfo and published when the service claimed the playback,
so the menu is complete before the first frame and opening it costs nothing.

"""The ``mode=syncplay`` plugin entry: one IPC message to the service.

The plugin invocation is transient — it cannot hold group state, an Api, or
the player — so everything SyncPlay lives in the service (phase-4 plan §2).
This handler only validates that a menu makes sense right now and sends
``SyncPlayMenu``; the service opens the menu on a dedicated worker thread.

"""Jellyfin account settings: the server-side preferences kofin already obeys.

Jellyfin resolves each playback's default audio and subtitle track against the
*account* rather than the client, and returns the result on every MediaSource
— which ``service/player.apply_default_tracks`` applies at first frame. The
preferences behind that resolution live only on the server, so until now the
only way to change them from a Kodi box was to open the web UI.

This is the Account tab's button for them: read live from ``/Users/Me``, edited
in a ``Dialog.select`` loop, written straight back. Each change is posted on
its own, because ``/Users/Configuration`` replaces the whole document — every
write is a read-modify-write of the full dict (see :func:`updated`), and a
failed one has to put the old value back or the list would go on showing
something the server never took.

Six of the sixteen ``UserConfiguration`` fields are here. The rest are left
alone deliberately: ``EnableNextEpisodeAutoPlay`` duplicates kofin's own
``playNextEnabled``, the display flags (``DisplayMissingEpisodes`` and kin)
change what ``/UserViews`` and ``/Items`` return and so would silently desync
the Kodi database, and the view lists overlap kofin's own library selection.

It blocks on a modal in the plugin process, which a settings button may do:
the node-invocation problem that pushes ``adduser.who_is_watching`` into the
service does not apply to a button (see that module's route handler).

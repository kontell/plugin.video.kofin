"""The addon backdrop: the server's splashscreen, or the bundled artwork.

``addon.xml`` names ``resources/media/fanart.jpeg`` as the addon's fanart, and
that file is never rewritten: Kodi keys cached textures on the source URL, so
an asset rewritten in place would keep rendering the old bytes. The server's
splashscreen goes to addon_data under a name that is its content hash
(``fanart-<sha256>.webp``), and :func:`profile_path` hands the current one to
the listings (``browse.with_backdrop``), which fall back to the bundled file
while the setting is off or nothing has been fetched yet. A new image is a new
URL, so no cache needs invalidating.

* **A daily floor gates the fetch.** ``_connect`` runs on every service start
  and every reconnect, and the splashscreen endpoint serves no ETag or
  Last-Modified, so there is no conditional GET to make.
* **The write is atomic.** Kodi may be reading the file to cache it; a
  partial write would cache a truncated image under a name that says it is
  complete.

:meth:`Api.splashscreen` records why the image is taken as WebP.

"""Embedded subtitles that arrive after the picture does.

A transcoded stream carries no subtitles, so a text track reaches Kodi as a
file the play route fetches from Jellyfin's delivery URL. The first request
for a track makes the server extract it with ffmpeg, which can take minutes,
so the play route waits only long enough to catch an already-extracted track
and hands anything slower here (``plugin/subtitles.localize``).

When the file lands, ``Player.setSubtitles`` puts it on the running playback.
The *Player* method takes a single path and adds it to the playback in flight;
the ListItem method of the same name takes a list and applies only before the
stream is opened. There is no ``addSubtitle`` on Player, whatever
``Player.AddSubtitle`` over JSON-RPC suggests.

Each attempt uses the play route's own short read budget and the loop sleeps
on the cancel event between them, so a service teardown or a stopped playback
is answered within one attempt. The whole chase ends at ``DEADLINE_SECONDS``,
and the stream menu still offers the track.

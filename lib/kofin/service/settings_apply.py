"""The settings diff engine: a registry of ``setting id -> handler(old, new)``
consulted from the service's ``onSettingsChanged``.

The table (``SettingsApplier.handlers``) holds one handler per setting whose
change the running service has to act on; everything not in the table is read
fresh wherever it is used. The whitelist handler computes add/remove sets
against the *synced* whitelist (sync.json), not the previous csv, so a
partially failed sync self-heals on the next apply.

Kodi fires ``onSettingsChanged`` while it loads the profile settings, and the
fresh-``Addon()``-per-call reads (needed for reuselanguageinvoker correctness)
can transiently return "" before the persisted value lands. So the applier
ignores every change until the service marks it ready, then re-baselines
against the settled store.

The same read can fail *after* ready, so emptying a guarded setting is
corroborated before it is believed (``_is_spurious_clear``).

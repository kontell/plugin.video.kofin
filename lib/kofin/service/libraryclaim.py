"""Claiming library-originated playback (shell refactor P2.3).

Kodi starts a synced row on its own — a song written as a direct stream
URL, a downloaded movie or episode whose row is a local file — and nothing
queues a play state for it. ``backfill_library_claim`` builds one from the
``Player.OnPlay`` announcement: map the Kodi id back to a Jellyfin id, fetch
(or, offline, reconstruct) the item, and push the claim so the player
reports it like any other. Moved verbatim out of ``service/player.py``,
where it was self-free module code beside the player class.

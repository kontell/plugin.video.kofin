"""The one place a toast's heading, icon and sound are decided.

Kodi takes the icon as a *string*: "info", "warning" and "error" select its own
three glyphs, and any other value is used as an image path
(``interfaces/legacy/Dialog.cpp``, which also turns an empty icon into "info").
So the level a caller asks for is what picks between kofin's icon and Kodi's:

* :data:`INFO` -- kofin reporting that something happened. The addon icon says
  who is talking, which is the useful information; Kodi's blue "i" says
  nothing a viewer needs.
* :data:`WARNING` / :data:`ERROR` -- something was refused or went wrong, and
  Kodi's glyph is the fastest way to read that at a glance. Branding a failure
  only softens it.

Sound is off by default and no caller turns it on. Kodi's own default is
``sound=True``, which is how two of kofin's error toasts ended up beeping
while the other fourteen did not.

Nothing here raises. A toast is cosmetic, and every caller sits on a path
where losing the *message* is survivable but losing the work behind it is not
-- a websocket callback that goes on to register capabilities, a sync worker
mid-library, a player callback thread.

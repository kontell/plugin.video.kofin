"""Jellyfin device profile, ported from pvr.kofin's BuildDeviceProfile.

Deliberate deviation from the C++ source: pvr.kofin clears DirectPlayProfiles
whenever a bitrate cap is set, because live-TV direct play ignores
MaxStreamingBitrate server-side. For VOD the server honors the cap in its
direct-play decision, so kofin keeps direct play available and lets the
server gate it per item.

``forceDirectPlay`` is scoped to video. It suppresses every video-side
constraint (HDR, width, streaming bitrate), but music delivery belongs to
``musicTranscode`` and its own cap, so forcing direct play for video does not
silently uncap music.

The same scoping holds the other way: ``forceRemux`` and ``forceTranscode``
withdraw the *video* DirectPlayProfile, never the audio one. A profile with no
audio DirectPlayProfile makes the server re-encode every song no matter what
the music settings say.

    * The video transcoding profile is a single progressive fragmented-MP4

      ``deny_video_stream_copy`` exists to suppress for the context item is
      the point here), and an encoder fallback costs quality-per-byte

      an open profile would answer "keep the FLAC" — the opposite of what
      the music toggle promises. The bitrate cap rides the Audio codec

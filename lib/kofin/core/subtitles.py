"""Subtitle files as Kodi wants them: the naming and the fetch (P2.6).

The pure half of the sidecar-subtitle work, shared by the play route
(``plugin/subtitles.localize``) and the late-subtitle chase
(``service/latesubs``): the cache directory every play writes into and
sweeps, the delivery URL with an extension Kodi has a parser for, and the
``<name>.<language>[.forced].<ext>`` filename Kodi reads the label back
from. One implementation for both halves is the invariant — a track that
arrives late is labelled exactly as it would have been on time — and
this module is where it lives; ``plugin/subtitles.py`` keeps the
route-facing surface and re-exports these names.

"""Jellyfin's lyric payload as timed lines for the skin overlay.

Jellyfin returns lyrics as a list of lines, each optionally carrying a start
time in .NET ticks (100 ns units)::

    {"Metadata": {}, "Lyrics": [{"Text": "Tonight", "Start": 5800000}]}

``Metadata.IsSynced`` looks like the field to branch on but is never set by
Jellyfin core — every response for a locally stored lyric carries an empty
``Metadata``. Whether a lyric is timed is decided by the presence of ``Start``
on the first line, which is what jellyfin-web does too.

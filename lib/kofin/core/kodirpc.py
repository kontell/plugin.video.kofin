    **Never call ``xbmc.Player.stop()``.** Kodi's binding for it is
    ``SendMsg(TMSG_MEDIA_STOP)`` with no ``DelayedCallGuard``, so the calling
    thread blocks on the app thread *holding the GIL* — unlike ``playnext``,
    ``playprevious`` and ``play``, which all wrap the same send in the guard.
    The app thread's stop path ends in ``~CVideoPlayer()``, which spins until
    its outbound job queue drains, and the two jobs ahead of ``OnPlayBackStopped``
    both write MyVideos. Kodi's SQLite busy handler sleeps and retries forever,
    so if any kofin thread is holding the MyVideos write lock it can never be
    released — that thread needs the GIL this one is sitting on. Kodi is then
    wedged on a blank screen with only a force-stop to get out.

    ``executeJSONRPC`` carries the guard Kodi forgot on ``stop()``, and
    ``Player.Stop`` is a ``PostMsg`` on Kodi's side, so this returns in
    microseconds and no other Python thread ever stalls behind it.

    Being asynchronous is the one behaviour change: playback is *requested* to
    stop, not stopped. Anything Kodi sequences for us needs no wait — the app
    thread runs its messages in order, so a ``player.play()`` issued afterwards
    is handled after the stop. ``wait_seconds`` is for callers that must not
    race the teardown from the Python side. Note it can only ever be a
    courtesy: ``Player.GetActivePlayers`` goes empty while ``~CVideoPlayer()``
    is still running, so an empty answer means "Kodi has let go of the

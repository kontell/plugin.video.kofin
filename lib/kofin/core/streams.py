"""Jellyfin MediaStreams <-> Kodi stream ordinals, and the stream-menu model.

Jellyfin numbers every stream of a MediaSource in one sequence — video, audio,
subtitle, and any sidecar subtitle files the server found beside the media.
Kodi numbers each *kind* separately, and counts only what is in the stream it
actually opened. Translating between the two is this module's whole job, and
it is pure so the mapping can be tested without a player.

Three facts shape it, all measured (docs/transcode-stream-selection-plan.md §2):

* A Jellyfin transcode carries exactly one audio track. The chosen
  ``AudioStreamIndex`` is baked into the HLS URL and no alternate renditions
  are offered, so audio can only change by resolving a new stream.
* A transcode carries no subtitles either. Text subtitles reach Kodi as
  attached external URLs instead, which is why ``attached_subtitles`` exists
  and why the subtitle ordinal depends on the play method.
* Direct play is the opposite: the container already holds every embedded
  stream, in Jellyfin's own index order, so there the ordinal is just the
  position within its kind.

    Two disjoint groups, and which apply turns on the play method:

    * **Sidecar** subtitles (``IsExternal``) are files beside the media, in no
      container. They are attached whatever the play method — this is the set
      kofin has always attached. They cost the server nothing to serve: the
      file already exists.
    * **Embedded** text subtitles are missing from a transcoded stream, so one
      is attached for it — *the one this playback was resolved with*, and no
      others. Attaching them on direct play would list every track twice: once
      read out of the container, once fetched over HTTP.

    Only one, because each embedded track is extracted on demand by the
    server, and Kodi opens every attached subtitle when it builds the demuxer
    rather than when one is picked. A track the server cannot produce costs
    Kodi a 20-second timeout before it moves to the next, so a film with
    several of them stalls for a minute or more before the picture settles —
    measured on a real library, where one track ground for 48 s and then
    answered 400. The rest stay reachable through the stream menu, which
    restarts into them (``needs_restart``), the same way an image subtitle
    has always worked on a transcode.

    Which one is :func:`preferred_embedded`'s answer; ``language`` is the
    viewer's configured subtitle language, passed in rather than read here so
    this module stays free of Kodi imports and testable without a player.

    Embedded *image* subtitles (PGS/DVDSUB) are never attached. The server
    serves them as a raw ``.sup`` — measured at 37 MB and 67 s of extraction
    for one track — and Kodi cannot render a standalone one anyway. On a
    transcode they are reachable only by burning them in (see
    ``deviceprofile.build(burn_subtitles=True)``); on direct play they are
    already in the container.

    Order is the order Kodi will list them in, which is what makes
    ``subtitle_ordinal`` able to answer at all.

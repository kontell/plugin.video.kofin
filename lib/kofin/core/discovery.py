"""Jellyfin's UDP auto-discovery (port 7359), client side.

Kodi-free on purpose, like :mod:`kofin.core.auth`: the dialog around this
lives in :mod:`kofin.plugin.serverpicker` and this module only talks to the
network.

The protocol is one plaintext datagram broadcast to 255.255.255.255:7359.
Every Jellyfin whose ``AutoDiscovery`` is on — the default — replies
**unicast** to the sender's ephemeral port with a small JSON object naming
itself: ``Address``, ``Id``, ``Name``, ``EndpointAddress``. Server-side that
is a background service which receives, serialises three strings and sends;
no database, no disk.

Which is why ``SCAN_SECONDS`` is a *retry* budget and not a patience one. A
reply measured 3 ms against a real server on this LAN (2026-09-01), so one
not seen within a few tens of milliseconds was lost rather than delayed, and
waiting longer recovers nothing — another probe does. The half that gets lost
is ours: an access point sends a broadcast frame at the lowest basic rate,
unacknowledged, buffered against the DTIM interval for sleeping clients,
while the server's answer comes back unicast and is comparatively safe. So
the window is spent re-broadcasting once a second rather than listening
harder.

Several classes of server never answer at any timeout, which is what the
caller's "nothing found" wording has to account for: ``AutoDiscovery`` turned
off, Docker bridge networking (a published UDP port does not receive
255.255.255.255 traffic), another subnet, and — easy to misread as a bug —
a second Jellyfin on a host where something already holds 7359, since only
one process per machine can bind it.

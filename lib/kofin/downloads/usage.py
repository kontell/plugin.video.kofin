"""What the downloads are costing on disk (D1).

Walked from the filesystem, not summed from the store, and that is the whole
point of the module. ``download.size_actual`` knows only the media files
kofin finished fetching: it cannot see an exported NFO, a poster, a subtitle
sidecar, a ``.part`` left by a transfer that died, or a row the store lost
track of — so its total is always smaller than the folder's, and a user
reconciling the two against their file manager would find kofin wrong. The
walk is stat-only (``DirEntry.stat().st_size``), never a read.

The three category directories are counted separately because they are the
only thing here kofin owns; everything else under the root goes to a single
"other" bucket rather than being left out. That bucket is the honest half of
the rule the deletion paths already follow — the root is user-configurable
and may be shared with other media — and it is what stops the total
disagreeing with ``du`` on a shared folder.

"""The kofin.db ``download`` table: what is downloaded, wanted, or failed.

One row per item, keyed by jellyfin id; a row leaves the table when its
download is removed or cancelled, or its file is found missing. The DDL lives
in :func:`kofin.sync.private.kofin_tables` so the table exists wherever
kofin.db exists.

State machine: queued -> active -> done | failed; failed -> queued on a
re-request (keeping ``bytes_done``, so an original resumes with a Range).
``active`` rows found at manager start are a crash's leftovers and go back
to queued (:func:`recover_interrupted`).

"""The library side of a download.

A download is a file on disk and a row in kofin's own store, and nothing of
Kodi's moves for it: the row keeps its plugin URL, the resolver plays the
local file for a downloaded item however it is reached (plugin/play.py), and
the badge and the tag reach the row through the catalogue's pass, which
re-plans the item with its download state as an input
(sync/backends/api/downloaded.py). Kodi's own play state is read back
through JSON-RPC by the mapped id, so the retention sweep still works
offline, and the local watched mark of a vanished download is left to the
server round-trip that already follows it.

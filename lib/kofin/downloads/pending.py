"""Userdata that could not reach the server, and its replay (plan W2.4).

Watching a downloaded item offline is the whole point of the feature, and
before this the watched flag and the resume point it produced were simply
dropped: Kodi announced the change, ``service/kodiuserdata`` tried to push
it, the transport failed, and the event was gone with nothing to retry it
(feasibility V6). Here it is parked instead, and replayed on the next
connect.

One row per item, not per event: a second event for the same item
overwrites the fields it carries and leaves the rest alone
(:func:`enqueue`). Replaying "played, position 0" after "position 1200"
would otherwise resurrect a stale position, and Findroid's known ghost —
an episode that comes back in Continue Watching after being finished
offline — is exactly that shape.

NULL means "unchanged": a row can carry a position without touching the
played flag, and vice versa.

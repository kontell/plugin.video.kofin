"""The conditional download-quality decision (plan W3.1/W3.2).

With the transcode toggles off this module answers "original" without a
server round trip. With one on, the decision is the *server's*, through
PlaybackInfo with the download device profile
(:func:`kofin.core.deviceprofile.build_download`): an item within every
limit — bitrate cap, resolution cap, the device's codec lists, the allowed
HDR types — answers ``SupportsDirectPlay`` and downloads as the original,
exactly phase 1's path; anything else hands back a ``TranscodingUrl`` whose
job stream-copies the compliant tracks and re-encodes only the offending
ones. A failed decision raises rather than falling back to the original:
silently downloading a 40 GB file the caps ruled out is worse than a retry.

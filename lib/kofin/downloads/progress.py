"""The download progress bar, on Kodi's own library-update surface (W3.4).

``xbmcgui.DialogProgressBG`` is the Python binding onto the same background
extended-progress window Kodi's library scanner reports through
(``CGUIDialogExtendedProgressBar``), so downloads render exactly the way a
scan does — the small corner bar, skinned by every skin's
``DialogExtendedProgressBar.xml``, rotating in place with any other active
bar (a library scan and a download simply alternate). kofin's own sync
already reports through this window (``sync/shims.progress``), and the
downloads bar deliberately matches it.

One aggregate bar for the whole queue, never one per worker: the window
cycles between registered handles every few seconds, so two per-worker
bars would read as flicker rather than parallelism. Progress is counted in
items — completed plus the active transfers' byte fractions, over
completed plus the store's remainder — the same unit Kodi's scanner uses.
That stays honest when a total is unknowable (a fraction nobody can
compute counts 0 until its item finishes) and when the queue grows
mid-run (the bar steps back, as the scanner's does when it discovers more
work).

Stop discipline (the thread-stop doctrine): nothing is created once the
manager is stopping — a GUI dialog touched during Kodi's exit is a classic
quit-wedge ingredient — and ``close`` runs unconditionally from the
manager's ``stop()`` after the workers joined, so no bar ghosts in the
corner. The offline hold closes it too (``idle``): a bar frozen at
"3 of 7" for the length of an outage would misstate work in flight.
